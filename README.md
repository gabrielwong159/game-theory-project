# 40.316 Game Theory Final Project
For this project, our team analysed a hypothetical card game, which is inspired by 2 frequency played poker card games: _Bridge_ and _Hearts_. For the purpose of evaluating our model and strategies, we simulate the game and its players, and observe the results of these simulations.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.6+

### Installation
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution
```
cd sim
python3 main.py
```

## Results
See [./sim/evaluation.ipynb](./sim/evaluation.ipynb) to observe the results of our various simulation.
